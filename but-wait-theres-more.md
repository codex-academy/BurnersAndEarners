# But wait, there's more

![](/img/phone-chat.png)

A week later, our friends are still arguing. They sent us some updates about what apps they had uninstalled.

* **Walter** sent: "I've stopped using Instantgam."
* **Jesse** sent: "Yo! I'm still all in.'"
* **Saul** sent: "My cats left, so I uninstalled Instantgam."
* **Gus** sent: "My customers have left Tooter, so I have too."

For their data, they sent:

* **Walter** sent: "It was 65MB."
* **Jesse** sent: "Went up to 350 this week, dawg."
* **Saul** sent: "It was only 124MB this week. That's it."
* **Gus** sent: "It was 273MB. I have scanned the receipts and emailed them to you."

Update your **Who, what, how much?** calculations using the new strings.

* Who uses the most data?
* Who uses the least data?
* Who uses the most apps?
* Who doesn't use Faceblock?
* For each person, estimate how much data each app uses. Use the data ratios from our friend at the network.
