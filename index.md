# Burners And Earners

Some friends of ours have cellphone with various social media apps installed. They've been arguing about how much data they're using, and how much it's cost them. They heard that we're developers, so they want use to run some numbers.

We asked them to WhutsUp us with **what apps they have**. The apps we're interested in are **Faceblock**, **Instantgam**, **Tooter**, **Snaptalk**, and **LankedOn**.

* **Walter** sent: "Hello. I've got Faceblock and Instantgam. I'm too old for the other ones."
* **Jesse** sent:  "Yo! I've got 'em all. Tooter, Faceblock, Instantgam, Snaptalk."
* **Saul** sent: "I'm on LankedOn for Business. And I have an Instantgam account for my cats. Oh, and Faceblock for my ex-husbands."
* **Gus** sent: "I use Tooter and Instantgam. My customers aren't on the others, so I can't get them to engage with my brand there."

Then we asked **how much data they've used this week**. Here's what they WhutsUpped us.

* **Walter** sent: "It was 67MB. Is that everything? I'm busy, you know."
* **Jesse** sent: "Damn, it was like 300MB. Dat Snaptalk is a data hog, yo."
* **Saul** sent: "I think 283MB. That's what the guy at the store said. I think it means MegaBites."
* **Gus** sent: "Around 150MB. I have the receipts if you need more precise figures."

A friend of ours at one of the cellphone networks tells us that Tooter and Faceblock use about the same amount of data, but Instantgam uses about 1.5 times those. Snaptalk uses about 3 times as much data as Tooter. LankedOn uses about half the data Faceblock does.

That means that Tooter : Facebook : Instantgam : Snaptalk : LankedOn is  2 : 2 : 3 : 6 : 1.

## Who, what, how much?

Take the string inputs above and calculate:

* Who uses the most data?
* Who uses the least data?
* Who uses the most apps?
* Who uses Faceblock?
* Who doesn't use Faceblock?
* For each person, estimate how much data each app uses. Use the data ratios from our friend at the network.
